When making the page, I started by tackling first the dropdown menu, as that seemed to be the biggest challenge in the whole design of the page, Turns out I'm still making changes to that. After soo much debate ended up going with a more sleek and modern direction; the first thing I needed to do was figure out the heading, which took me like two days to settle on one. After intensive googling, Youtubing, and multiple blogs, I chose one. I stumbled across the CSS variables and a whole new world I didn't even know of yet.

Now with that done, I Have to Select the font for my page, background images, and also the color scheme to fit my page, which is more difficult that the coding part.
