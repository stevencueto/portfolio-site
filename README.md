# portfolio-site
When making the page, I started by tackling first the dropdown menu, as that seemed to be the biggest challenge in the whole design of the page, Turns out I'm still making changes to that. After soo much debate ended up going with a more sleek and modern direction; the first thing I needed to do was figure out the heading, which took me like two days to settle on one. After intensive googling, Youtubing, and multiple blogs, I chose one. I stumbled across the CSS variables and a whole new world I didn't even know of yet.

Now with that done; My tasks left are to select the font for my page, background images, and color scheme; which has proven to be more difficult than the coding part.

# Saturday

Saturday was about adjusting the headers and making my resume on PDF, and website. I wanted them to look as similar as possible to have a nice consistency but didn't feel like uploading the pdf version of my resume was the right move professionally speaking, so I took the time to make it interactive, still having issues with the grid, as I find myself not comfortable with it as I am with Flex-box. I learned how to make a sliding gallery for my projects.

# sunday

About me is done,  went back to change the resume to make it even more like the actual pdf for de desktop version, still challenged with the grid. Made a decision for the Skills and contacts about the icons and images I want to display.

I'm researching to make a form for my contact page. I find myself not pleased with the way my projects look, if I have the time, I have to go back and make them look presentable for my portfolio. getting more and more into my obsessive perfectionist tendencies as the day progresses. Nothing seems to meet my standards of perfection as of right now.

I'm also forgetting to commit and update my README file.

Inital Form idea did't work, on my way to make another one one, which might be even more impresive.

# monday

Website is pretty much done, only missing how to make the forms submit, not sure if we can use a helper site or have to make it ourselfs, tomorrow i'll ask ryan about it to see what we can do.
took the acordion i'd made before and added it to my mobile design, maybe i'll add it to my desktop for the form only.
