When making the page, I started by tackling first the dropdown menu, as that seemed to be the biggest challenge in the whole design of the page, Turns out I'm still making changes to that. After soo much debate ended up going with a more sleek and modern direction; the first thing I needed to do was figure out the heading, which took me like two days to settle on one. After intensive googling, Youtubing, and multiple blogs, I chose one. I stumbled across the CSS variables and a whole new world I didn't even know of yet.

Now with that done, I Have to Select the font for my page, background images, and also the color scheme to fit my page, which is more difficult that the coding part.

was al about changing th animations to the headers, also making my resume on the pdf version and the resume for the website, i wanted them to look as similar as posible to have a nice consistency but didn't feel like uploading the pdf version of my resume was the right move professionally speaking, so I took the time to make it interactive, still havin issues with grid, as I find myself not comfortable with it as I am with Flex-box.

Made my bio, also went back to change the resume to make it even more like the actual resume on the pdf for de desktop version, still challenged with the grid.
